# dotfiles for my FreeBSD, Linux and Cygwin environment

## dotfiles

dotfiles store your personal system settings. These are mine. When compared to Windows' broken registry, dotfiles are bliss.

I mainly use vim, gvim and Git on Cygwin with zsh as my favorite shell. It might be a very special setup, you've been warned.
